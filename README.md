# cartoMapBoilerplate
A simple project boilerplate for using CartoJS and Leaflet. 

## Instructions to run the project locally:

* Install Gulp on your machine if you don't already have it installed, and then install it locally on the cloned project's folder:
```
  npm install gulp-cli -g
  npm install gulp -D
```

* Install node dependencies:
```
  npm install
```

* That's all. Go to the project's folder and run: 
```
  gulp serve
```

* You can compress .png, .svg, etc. By creating a folder called img in the project's root and running: 
```
  gulp optimize
```
